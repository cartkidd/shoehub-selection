## Project 3 - The Score (A MERN Stack App)
## Overview
This MERN Stack app was the third project that I completed whilst at Gw. This project was completed over the course of Forever days . To facilitate successful collaboration over the duration of the project, we used Trello to set ourselves task deadlines, Figma to wireframe our app and Git, GitHub, Slack and VSCode Live Share to facilitate communication whilst coding.



## Brief
Listed below are the requirement that our team had to meet whilst building the app:

We had to:

Work in a team, using git to code collaboratively
Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and frontend
Use an express API to serve the data from a Mongo database
Consume our API with a separate front-end built in React
Build a complete product which had multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least some of the models
Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that were significant enough to know which features were core MVP and which could be cut
Have a visually impressive design
Be deployed online so that it could be publicly accessible
