## Project 3 - Shoehub-Selectio (A MERN Stack App)
## Overview
This MERN Stack app was the third project that I completed whilst at Gw. This project was completed over the course of Forever days . 

## Brief
Listed below are the requirement that Ihad to meet whilst building the app:

We had to:


Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and frontend
Use an express API to serve the data from a Mongo database
Consume my API with a separate front-end built in React
Build a complete product which had multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least some of the models
Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that were significant enough to know which features were core MVP and which could be cut
Have a visually impressive design
Be deployed online so that it could be publicly accessible
