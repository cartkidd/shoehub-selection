Use an express API to serve the data from a Mongo database
Consume my API with a separate front-end built in React
Build a complete product which had multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least some of the models
Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that were significant enough to know which features were core MVP and which could be cut
Have a visually impressive design
Be deployed online so that it could be publicly accessible
